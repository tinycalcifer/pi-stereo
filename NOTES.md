# Raspberry Pi 3 B+ audio streamer client

Create an RPi-based audio streaming client that, when connected to a receiver
or powered speaker, streams Spotify Connect and AirPlay audio over WiFi.

# 6. Dec. 2020

Trying out using Ubuntu Server instead of Raspbian. We'll see how this goes.

RPi materials:

* RPi 3 model B+, with case and heatsinks, powersupply, 16GB microSDHC card
* [Ubuntu Server 20.04.1 LTS, 32-bit (begins download)][ubuntu_image] from the [Ubuntu Pi Download page][ubuntu_download_page]
* [spotifyd][spotifyd] -- enables Pi as a Spotify Connect client
* [shairport-sync][shairport-sync] -- enables Pi as an AirPlay audio target
* [cockpit][cockpit] (optional) -- web-based admin panel for easy maintenance

## Steps

### Image the Pi

Get the image, burn it with etcher. Easy. If you don't know how, Ubuntu provides an [Ubuntu Server on RPi installation guide][ubuntu-guide].

Slide the card into the Pi while it's powered off.

### Prep for boot

I'm using Ethernet for initial setup, so no further prep. You can also modify the `network-config` file in the `system-boot` section of the SD card before installing it in the Pi to set up WiFi. See the "Wi-Fi or Ethernet" sectio of the [Ubuntu Server isntall guide][ubuntu-guide] for details.

[ubuntu-guide]: https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi

### First boot and initial config

This will be configured remotely using SSH.

First, find the Pi's IP address.

Windows: `arp -a | findstr b8-27-eb` will find all RPis on your network (except for some RPi 4's -- you'll need `dc-a6-32` instead for those) that Windows can see via ARP (this might not work for some odd network configurations; I just checked by DHCP leases file on my DHCP server)

Then use PuTTY or WSL to ssh to that IP using the username `ubuntu` with the password `ubuntu`; you'll be asked to change the password on first connection, and you'll have to reconnect with the new password afterwards.

#### Configure Wi-Fi (if you're using it)

Ubuntu Server uses netplan.  I use vim; you can use `nano` if you prefer

```bash
sudo vim /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
```

Add a wifi configuration to the end of the file, make sure `wifis:` is indented in line with the `ethernets:` section (i.e. it's under the `networks:` section):

```yaml
    wifis:
        wlan0:
            dhcp4: true
            optional: true
            access-points:
                "Your_SSID_HERE":
                    password: "your_WPA2_password_HERE"
```

Then activate this configuration with

```bash
sudo netplan generate && sudo netplan apply
```

Use `ip a show dev wlan0` to see the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses assigned; if you don't see an address, you need to check your configuration and re-run generate/apply


#### Set the hostname

I picked `pi-stereo`; pick whatever you like

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname pi-stereo
```

### install updates

We want to have our system up to date and working!

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

### install a few support packages

```bash
sudo apt install alsa-utils alsa-base
```

### (optional) install cockpit (web-based admin tool)

```bash
sudo apt install cockpit
```

And then visit `https://pi-stereo.local:9090` (replacing `pi-stereo.local` with your hostname or IP as needed), logging on with `ubuntu` and the password you use for that account

## Setting up `spotifyd` for Spotify Connect

Get the `linux-armv6-full` variants by downloading the `.tar.gz` and the `.sha512` files.

As of this writing, that's done with two `curl` commands:

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd/releases/download/v0.2.24/spotifyd-linux-armv6-full.tar.gz
curl -LO https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd/releases/download/v0.2.24/spotifyd-linux-armv6-full.sha512
```

Then check the integrity of the download

```bash
shasum -c spotifyd-linux-armv6-full.sha512
```

Now unpack and move the binary:

```bash
tar xzf spotifyd-linux-armv6-full.tar.gz
sudo mv -i spotifyd /usr/local/bin/
```

And now the fun part:

### Configuring `spotifyd`

Create a non-root user to run spotifyd as:

```bash
sudo addgroup spotify
sudo adduser --ingroup spotify spotify
sudo usermod -a -G audio spotify
```

Create a directory to hold cached songs

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/cache/spotifyd
sudo chown spotify:spotify !$
```

Create a file `/etc/spotifyd.conf` and change its owner to be `spotify` and set it so no other user (other than root or people who can become root) can read your password:

```bash
sudo touch /etc/spotifyd.conf
sudo chown spotify:spotify !$
sudo chmod a=,u=rw,g=r !$
```

Now edit the config *as the spotify user*:

```bash
 sudo -u spotify vim /etc/spotifyd.conf
```

Using these contents (make changes as needed for your account and preferences):

```toml
[global]
# Your Spotify account name and password
username = spotify_username
password = spotify_password

# How spotifyd will play; you'll need to change this if you use some unusual
# audio system on Server, like PulseAudio
backend = alsa

# alsa device: usually 'sysdefault'
device = sysdefault

# The alsa mixer channel to use
mixer = Headphone

# The volume controller. [softvol, alsa, alsa_linear]
volume_controller = alsa

# Name to advertise in Spotify clients. NO SPACES
device_name = Pi_Stereo

# The audio bitrate to stream. 96, 160 or 320 kbit/s
bitrate = 320

# Absolute path to use for song cache
cache_path = /var/cache/spotifyd

# If you don't want to cache at all, set this TRUE
no_audio_cache = false

# Volume on startup between 0 and 100
initial_volume = 95

# If set to true, enables volume normalisation between songs.
volume_normalisation = true

# The normalisation pregain that is applied for each song.
normalisation_pregain = -10

# The port `spotifyd` uses to announce its service over the network.
zeroconf_port = 1234

# if you need an HTTP proxy on your network to connect to Spotify,
# set it here
# proxy = "http://proxy.example.org:8080"

# The displayed device type in Spotify clients.
# Can be unknown, computer, tablet, smartphone, speaker, tv,
# avr (Audio/Video Receiver), stb (Set-Top Box), and audiodongle.
device_type = avr
```

Now you can test by running 

```bash
sudo -u spotify /usr/local/bin/spotifyd --no-daemon
```

Open Spotify on some other device (or browser) and you should be able to select `Pi_Stereo` as a play target.

Press Ctrl-C to stop spotifyd

### Set spotifyd to start automatically with systemctl

Get the [spotifyd.service file][service-file] from the `contrib/` directory in Spotifyd's GitHub (**note this is v0.2.24; you may need to update version num in URL for future relases**), and put it in the systemd repository.

```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd/v0.2.24/contrib/spotifyd.service
```

Now edit the `spotifyd.service` file and *replace* the entire `[Service]` section with:

```conf
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/spotifyd --no-daemon --config-path /etc/spotifyd.conf
User=spotify
Group=spotify
Restart=always
RestartSec=12
```

(These edits point to the right binary path, specify the config file, and make the daemon run as the `spotify` user for security).

Now install the service:

```bash
sudo mv spotifyd.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Make sure spotifyd is not running, then start the service with:

```bash
sudo systemctl start spotifyd.service
sudo systemctl status !$
```

Look at the log printed by the `status` subcommand above and make sure the service is running.

Now enable the service to start at boot time:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable spotifyd.service
```

[service-file]: https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd/blob/v0.2.24/contrib/spotifyd.service

## Setup AirPlay target

```bash
sudo apt install shairport-sync
```

That should be it; it'll use your hostname as the airport target name (e.g. `Pi-stereo`)
